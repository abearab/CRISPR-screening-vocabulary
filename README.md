## Terms
List of terms related to CRISPR screening, etc.

- **Forward genetics**
  - Screening approach in which genes involved in the phenotype of interest are identified by screening genetically perturbed cells.

- **Pooled CRISPR screen**
  - A technique in which genetically encoded perturbations are introduced in bulk and read out with sequencing or imaging technology.

- **Arrayed CRISPR screens**
  - A technique in which perturbations are introduced in individual reaction compartments and remain physically separated.

- **High-content CRISPR screens**
  - Screens combining complex models, perturbations and stimuli with data-rich read-outs.

- **Biological replicates**
  - Separately conducted repetitions of the same CRISPR screen using cells from different individuals or different passages of a cell line

- **Coverage**
  - The average number of cells per guide RNA (gRNA) in a CRISPR screen.

- **Multiplicity of infection (MOI)** 
  - The average number of virions (and, by extension, guide RNAs (gRNAs)) delivered per cell during infection.

- **Genetic interactions**
  - The combined effect of the simultaneous perturbation of several genes, which may deviate from the sum of the individual effects.

- **Positive selection screens**
  - Also known as enrichment screens. Cells with the phenotype of interest are selected (enriched) in the screens; other cells are depleted.

- **Negative selection screens**
  - Also known as dropout screens. Cells with the phenotype of interest are depleted in the screen; other cells are maintained.

- **Effective dose**
  - The intensity of a perturbation (such as a drug or virus) that causes an effect (such as cell death) in a specified percentage of cells.

- **Screening hits**
  - Target genes identified as being associated with the phenotype of interest in a CRISPR screen.

- **scCRISPR-seq**
  - An umbrella term for a group of methods that combine pooled CRISPR sequencing with a single-cell sequencing read-out.

- **Manifold learning**
  - A set of machine learning methods that seek to uncover hidden structures in the data through dimensionality reduction.

- **Variants of uncertain significance**
  - Genetic variants for which there is insufficient genetic evidence to support or exclude a causal phenotypic effect.

- **Saturation genome editing**
  - Introduction of many genome edits into a gene or regulatory element, with the goal of comprehensively assessing their phenotypic impact.

- **Synthetic lethality**
  - Special case of a genetic interaction in which knockouts of two genes are individually tolerated, but their combination is lethal to cells.

- **False positives**
  - Putative CRISPR screening hits that do not validate, which can be caused by technical biases.

- **False negatives**
  - Potential CRISPR screening hits that would have validated but were missed, which can be caused by suboptimal screening conditions.

- **Population bottlenecks**
  - Reductions in the genetic diversity among a pool of cells owing to external events.

- **Genetic drift**
  - Genetic changes over time in a pool of cells, caused by random and uncontrolled events.

- **Unique molecular identifiers**
  - Short barcodes that uniquely identify individual DNA or RNA molecules.
